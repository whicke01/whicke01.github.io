<h1>Will's Life</h1>
<h2>How I Got Here,</h2>
<p>After graduating high school from Deerfield Academy in 2009 I went on to attend 
Tufts University.I declared my major as Civil Engineering my freshman year. 
As I continued my studies my interests shifted toward the computer aspect of Civil 
Engineering,such as programming in Visual Lisp for AutoCAD. This was the beginning 
of my venture into the world of Computer Science. By my Junior year I was very 
interested in computer science. This interest lead me to decide to finish my degree 
in Civil Engineering and then take a fifth year at Tufts to continue my studies in 
computer science. I graduated in May 2014. </p>

<h2>Here,</h2>
<p>I am currently working on a Morh's Circle calculator, a mobile game, and a few other 
side projects during this summer while I look for a job. I am interested in a job that 
combines both civil engineering and computer science/programming. I am living in the 
greater Boston area, for this summer.
</p>
