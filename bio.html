<h2>Current Life/School</h2>
<p>After graduating high school from Deerfield Academy in 2009 I went on to attend Tufts University.I declared my major as Civil Engineering my freshman year. As I continued my studies my interests
shifted toward the computer aspect of Civil Engineering,such as programming in Visual Lisp in CAD. This was the beginning of my venture into the world of Computer Science. By my Junior year I was
very interested in comp-sci. This interest lead me to decide to finish my degree in Civil Engineering and then take a fifth year at Tufts to continue my studies in comp-sci. This will end in the
spring of 2014 when i graduate with a double degree. </p>
