<h2>The Lore</h2>
<p> “there is nothing as bad as a dead squirrel in memory,” said Professor Sheldon. 
He pauses for a moment then starts off on a tangent, “Well almost nothing. There was that time that we had undead squirrels crawling out of the Halligan basement…”
</br></br>
In 2015, nuclear research conducted by graduate students in the chemistry department and occult experiments initiated by stressed-out Comp40 students triggered a rift in reality that opened a portal to hell in the basement of Halligan Hall. The only way to close the portal and save the world is to delve deep into the madness-inducing labyrinth and slay the Dead Squirrel.
