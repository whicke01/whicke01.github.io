<h2>Set Up</h2>
<p>This is a list of steps on how to get DSS onto your android mobile device.</br>
This is the second step in the list.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>When you enter the immersive world of Dead Squirrel Story, you will find yourself looking at an over-world map. 
<img src='./web_site/Screenshot_2014-05-04-15-08-30.png' slt="Screenshot of the overworld/dungeon map"
            height = "300" width="480"/></br>
This map indicates where you are with the color white, </p>
<p id="RED">where you can go with the color red, </p>
<p id="BLUE">where you have already been with the color blue, </p>
<p id="GREY">and rooms you can reach but have not gone to with the color grey.</p>
<p id="PURPLE">It also notes the location of the boss with purple. </p>
<p>Every time you enter a new room, you will encounter a random enemy. 
<img src='./web_site/imp.png' slt="Screenshot of the fight with imp"
            height = "300" width="480"/>
To beat the enemy, you must use your three pieces of equipment in tandem for optimal 
combat efficacy, by selecting different attack types and timing them . 
Once the enemy has fallen, the room will be open for looting. 
Using the onscreen menu option “Loot”, you can take treasure from the room. 
Then, using the menu options for changing weapons and changing armor, 
you can customize your experience by changing your combat gear, 
or inspect your character using the stats option.

<h2>The building process</h2>
<p>
Dead Squirrel Story came from a desire to provide a challenging experience on a mobile 
platform, while still integrating the light-hearted spirit of the Tufts CS department. 
We decided to base the game around the famous “Dead Squirrel” and build our own piece 
of the legend. 
Using resources gained in Comp 23, and in our own experience as programmers, 
we built an RPG engine from scratch using the Android SDK. 
With a combat system that takes cues from Dark Souls and Final Fantasy, 
and a map-traversal system that would be right at home in a Comp15 homework 
assignment, Dead Squirrel Story took shape as a grand adventure through the 
bowels of Halligan Hall.
